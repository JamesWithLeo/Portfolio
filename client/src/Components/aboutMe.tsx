        I am James, a self-taught programmer forced to study hard to achieve my
        goals. Just like others, I love tea and{" "}
        <span className="cursor-default underline">music</span>. Other than
        that, I’m a homebody, meaning I’m not an active person. I’d rather stay
        inside my house scrolling through my phone or coding websites
